/**
 * INVESTIGATOR BRIEF ASSEMBLY
 * ==========================================================================
 * The investigator's screen is a review surface, so what it shows is itself a
 * claim. These functions are pure: they turn a case record, a gate verdict and a
 * kinship summary into the exact rows a reviewer reads, with no I/O, so the
 * mapping the screen depends on is unit-tested rather than only looked at.
 *
 * Two rules the mapping obeys:
 *
 *   • Nothing is promoted by its presence. A case that has no certification, no
 *     approval or no recorded basis renders as exactly that. There is no default
 *     label that reads better than the underlying fact.
 *
 *   • A gap is enumerated, not summarised away. Failed gate rules, unresolved
 *     relationship claims, awaiting conflicts, unrecorded basis and blocked
 *     sources each become their own row naming the rule, so a reviewer can act
 *     on one rather than on an impression.
