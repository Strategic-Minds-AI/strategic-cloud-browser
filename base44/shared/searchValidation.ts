/**
 * STRICT SEARCH VALIDATION — PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE, EVIDENCE AND IDENTITY GATES
 * ==========================================================================
 * Derived from the professional standards of the three leading skip-tracing
 * data companies and the statutes they operate under:
 *
 *   TLOxp (TransUnion)   — subscriber terms carry an explicit "Permissible Use"
 *                          clause; permissible purpose is defined by FCRA §604
 *                          [15 U.S.C. §1681b]. Data is furnished "under the
 *                          following circumstances and no other".
 *   Tracers              — investigator-led research software; the standard it
 *                          sets is currency and completeness of the source data,
 *                          so a stale or unavailable source must be reported as
 *                          such rather than silently treated as a null result.
 *   LexisNexis Risk      — identity verification and due-diligence posture; the
 *                          standard it sets is that identity is established by
 *                          corroborating records, not by a single match.
 *
 * The governing compliance frameworks are FCRA (§604 permissible purpose and
 * §607(b) maximum possible accuracy), DPPA (driver records have their own
 * permitted-use list and are narrower than FCRA), GLBA (financial information),
 * and the Genealogical Proof Standard / FRE 702 for the evidentiary output.
 *
 * Every rule below is either BLOCKING, MAJOR or MINOR. A single BLOCKING
 * violation fails the whole result — `ok` is false and the caller must refuse
 * the operation. There is no scoring that can outvote a blocking rule.
 *
 * This module is deliberately pure: no SDK, no network, no entity access. It is
 * the rule table, and the caller decides what to do with the verdict.
