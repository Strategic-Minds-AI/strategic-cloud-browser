/**
 * SERVICE CATALOG — the single source of truth for what this platform sells.
 * ==========================================================================
 * Read by the admin dashboard, the service pages, the run engine, and the
 * marketing site, so all four can never drift apart.
 *
 * Every workflow below follows the same production spine that managed data
 * and browser-automation firms actually run, because that spine is what
 * buyers audit for: intake → authorization gate → feasibility sample →
 * build → human sample gate → production run → evidence capture → QA →
 * policy guardian → independent validation → delivery → monitoring.
 *
 * Per-service differences are in WHAT each step acts on, not in whether the
 * step exists. Pricing figures are published market ranges gathered from
 * competitor pricing pages, not quotes from this platform.
