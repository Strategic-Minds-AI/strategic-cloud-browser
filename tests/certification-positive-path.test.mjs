/**
 * POSITIVE CERTIFICATION PATH — the whole chain, and every way it is refused.
 * ==========================================================================
 * Proves the complete authorised workflow end to end:
 *
 *   evidence retrieval -> preserved source -> identity resolution -> kinship
 *   analysis -> independent QA -> independent Validator -> deterministic
 *   certification -> investigator approval -> certified report -> authorised
 *   delivery
 *
 * IMPORTANT — these are SYNTHETIC fixtures. They are constructed in this file,
 * never read from the database and never written to it. A green run here proves
 * the RULES permit a certified delivery; it is NOT evidence that any real case
 * has been certified. Real-case validation is a separate exercise that requires
 * a genuine case with genuine preserved evidence and a named investigator's
 * approval, and no automated test may stand in for it.
 *
 * The negative half is the load-bearing half: rejection, staleness, tampering,
 * conflicting evidence and a missing approval must each be refused.
